# Project Goal

Create a data pipeline and data lake that will serve as the basis for
making queries about global (language-specific) textual news
content. In particular, the data resources are geared toward queries
tracking keyword emergence and life-cycle. 

For example, it should be easy to write a query to track the emergence
of the keywords "Climate Change" and discover when and where they
emerged; how their used developed in the context of the whole
text-news ecosystem; and what non-news domains were linked (via
literal hyperlink) to their use. 

I am particularly interested in using this dataset to see how
different news domains within similar ideological ecosystems get
"on-message" over time, and how that coherence changes around specific
events (i.e. elections).
